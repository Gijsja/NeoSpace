# Project Brief: LocalBBS "Creative OS"

**Date**: January 6, 2026
**Author**: [Your Name/Antigravity], Lead Experience Architect
**Status**: Design Phase Complete

## 1. Executive Summary

**LocalBBS** is not just a chat application; it is a **Creative Communication Operating System**. In an era of sterile, grid-locked social platforms, we are building a "Digital Third Place" that honors the chaotic, expressive soul of the early web (BBS culture) while leveraging the robust, server-authoritative architecture of modern distributed systems.

Our mission is to reconcile two opposing forces: **System Correctness** (The Trust) and **User Sovereignty** (The Vibe).

## 2. Problem Statement

The current landscape of real-time communication is bifurcated:

1.  **Utilities** (Slack, Discord): Efficient, clean, but sterile and conformist. Users are interchangeable rows in a database.
2.  **Social** (Instagram, TikTok): Expressive, but algorithmic, exploitative, and ephemeral.

There is no modern home for **Communities of Practice**—places where technical users, artists, and friends can hang out, code together, and express unique identities without algorithmic interference.

## 3. Experience Goals

My 50-year design philosophy centers on **"Tools for Conviviality"**. We are not building an app; we are building a _workshop_.

1.  **Dignity of Data**: We treat user data as sacred. The "System Internals" view is not a debug tool; it is a transparency contract.
2.  **The "Messy" Human**: We reject the tyranny of the grid. The "Identity Canvas" (MySpace 2.0) allows for overlap, chaos, and texture.
3.  **Code as First-Class Media**: Code is not just text; it is an interactive medium to be shared, run, and experienced natively in the feed.

## 4. Target Audience

- **The Creative Coder**: Users who speak p5.js and Three.js fluently.
- **The Digital Homesteader**: Users who want to own their space and data.
- **The Community Architect**: Admins who need robust, truthful tools to manage their tribes.

## 5. Scope & Deliverables (Design Phase)

We have delivered a comprehensive high-fidelity design suite (#11 distinct artifacts) covering the full user journey:

### A. The Core Utility (Stability)

- **Authentication**: Trustworthy Google Auth flow.
- **Connectivity**: "System Internals" (Connection Doctor) for server-state transparency.
- **Unified Dashboard**: A "Mega-View" integrating all workflows.

### B. The Creative Engine (Expression)

- **Creative Code Editor**: A secure, sandboxed IDE for Three.js/p5.js.
- **Embedded Code Output**: Rich media cards that render live sketches in the feed.
- **Rich Interactions**: Sticker Boards, Voice Waveforms.

### C. The Social Spatiality (Presence)

- **Identity Canvas**: A customizable, MySpace-inspired profile wall (5 aesthetic themes delivered).
- **Ambient Lobby**: A non-linear, spatial visualization of community presence.

## 6. Design Strategy

Our aesthetic direction is **"Functional Maximalism"**.

- **The Foundation**: A deep, reliable "Dark Slate" (#0F172A) that recedes, allowing content to pop.
- **The Typography**: Inter for UI (Legibility), Monospace for Truth (Data/Code), and user-choice for expression.
- **The Interaction**: We use **Mode Switching** (Chat vs. Code vs. Ambient) to manage cognitive load without stripping power.

---

## 7. Roadmap & Timeline

- **Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)** - Core wireframes and user flow validation.
- **Phase 2: Prototyping (Next)** - Interactive sandbox for the Code Editor and Sticker positioning logic.
- **Phase 3: Implementation** - Frontend build (React/Three.js) and Backend socket integration.
