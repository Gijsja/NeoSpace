# NeoSpace (MySpace 2.0) — Product Vision & Philosophy

NeoSpace is a social platform centered on persistent, user-authored identity spaces rather than algorithmic feeds.
The core unit is the Wall: a spatial, customizable digital environment.

Principles:
- Anti-algorithm
- User ownership
- Chaos as a feature
- Social without performance
